## Next steps

- finish redux setup
- finish the "add a plant" wizard
- write instructions
- this is a two part lab to review what has been covered in this unit
- students should be given some starter code
- they need to implement routing and redux
- they should make a custom hook that captures form input, to be used in the wizard
- they can implement whatever tailwind they want (there is an example wireframe if they'd like to work off that)
